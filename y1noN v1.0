y1noN v1.0 - Email Search Tool
This batch script is a simple command-line tool that simulates an email search. Below is a breakdown of its features and functionality:

Initialization:

The script starts with @echo off, which prevents the command prompt from displaying each command before it executes.
cls clears the screen, and color 0A sets the text color to green on a black background.
Header:

An ASCII art header is displayed to introduce the tool, showcasing its name and purpose.
Main Menu:

The script enters a menu loop where the user can choose from four options:
[1] Search for Email Address: Simulates an email search.
[2] View Search History: Currently not implemented.
[3] Help Center: Provides instructions on how to use the tool.
[4] Exit: Closes the program.
The user makes a selection, and the script validates the input. If the choice is invalid, the user is prompted to try again.
Email Search Functionality:

If the user selects option 1, the script prompts for an email address to search for.
It simulates the email search process and displays a success message, indicating the email was "found."
Search History:

Option 2 is a placeholder for future functionality, currently displaying a message that it's not implemented.
Help Center:

Option 3 gives users instructions on how to use the tool and reminds them that the current version simulates the functionality rather than performing real searches.
User Interaction:

The script uses pause to wait for user input before returning to the menu, ensuring a smooth user experience.
